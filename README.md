# Encryption with OpenPGP in React

This repository shows how to integrate file encryption and decryption using OpenPGP standard in React. Here Symmetric encryption is used.

## OpenPGP

OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a free and open-source encryption standard used to secure email communication, files, and other data. It provides end-to-end encryption, which means that the data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient with their private key. OpenPGP uses public key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data, and digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data. It is widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations to protect sensitive information and ensure secure communication.

## OpenPGP.js

OpenPGPjs is a free and open-source implementation of the OpenPGP encryption standard in JavaScript. It allows developers to integrate OpenPGP encryption and decryption functionality into web applications, making it possible to secure data and communications directly in the browser. OpenPGPjs supports various encryption algorithms and features, such as key management, digital signatures, and message compression. It is designed to work in modern web browsers and can be used in combination with other web technologies, such as React, Angular, and Node.js. OpenPGPjs is widely used in web-based applications that require secure communication and data protection, such as online file sharing, chat applications, and secure email clients.
